## 1) Purpose

This document prevents illegal, deceptive, or unsafe output—**without blocking
unrelated deployments**.

**Compliance must do two things:**

1. **Protect users and the business** (law/safety/truth-in-advertising).
2. **Help deployments succeed** by proposing edits when content fails checks.

**Rule of thumb**: If content changes are unrelated to regulated claims (e.g.,
blog formatting, nav links, spelling fixes), compliance should **warn, not
block**.

---

## 2) Enforcement Model (What Blocks vs What Warns)

All checks fall into one of three severities:

### A. BLOCKER (must block publish)

Block only when there’s a real risk of illegality, deception, or serious safety
harm.

**Examples (Blockers):**

- False license/certification claims (or missing license number in ads where
  required)
- Fabricated testimonials/reviews
- Guaranteed outcomes (“100% waterproof”, “guaranteed to increase value”)
- Unsafe instructions presented as safe (e.g., silica dust cutting without
  PPE/controls)
- Illegal guidance (evading permits, bypassing safety rules)
- Medical/health claims

### B. REQUIRED (must be fixed before release _only if the page is in a regulated category_)

These are mandatory **only** when the page is:

- an advertisement/marketing page,
- a proposal/estimate template,
- a service page intended to solicit paid work,
- or a page that includes safety-sensitive how-to guidance.

**Examples (Required in regulated contexts):**

- HIC license disclosure on marketing/ads/service pages
- Clear disclaimers on DIY/safety content
- No misleading price/time promises

### C. RECOMMENDED (never blocks)

Best practices that improve professionalism and reduce dispute risk—**warnings
only**.

**Examples (Recommended):**

- Adding photo-permission reminders
- Adding “unforeseen conditions” estimate note
- Accessibility-friendly language and options

## 3) Page Classification (So Compliance Knows When To Enforce)

Every page should be treated as one of the following:

1. **MARKETING** (service pages, landing pages, ads, promotional posts)
2. **ESTIMATE/CONTRACT TEMPLATE** (proposal text, contract clauses, pricing
   tables)
3. **EDUCATIONAL/DIY** (how-to, guides, tutorials)
4. **GENERAL** (mission, about, photo galleries, blog reflections, site updates)

**Default classification = GENERAL** unless the content clearly markets
services, quotes pricing, or provides DIY instruction.

---

## 4) NJ HIC Disclosures (Only When Applicable)

### Business Identity (use in MARKETING + ESTIMATE/CONTRACT contexts)

- **Legal Business Name**: Tillerstead LLC
- **NJ HIC Registration Number**: **13VH10808800**
- **Trade Scope**: Carpentry, Ceramic Tile, Waterproofing _(ensure scope matches
  what you actually offer/are registered for)_

**Marketing Disclosure (recommended placement)** Include on service pages,
landing pages, and ad copy footers:

> Licensed New Jersey Home Improvement Contractor (HIC) #13VH10808800 —
> Tillerstead LLC

---

## 5) Contract / Estimate Requirements (Templates Only)

When generating contracts or estimates intended for signature, include (at
minimum):

- Contractor legal name + business address + phone
- Prominent HIC registration number
- Detailed scope of work
- Itemized pricing and allowances
- Start date and substantial completion target (or clearly stated scheduling
  method)
- Payment schedule tied to milestones
- Change order process (written, priced, signed)
- Warranty terms (what’s covered / excluded)
- Dispute handling process
- Cancellation / rescission notice where required under NJ home improvement
  rules _(If you include a rescission clause, quote from your verified template
  language—do not freestyle statutory wording.)_

---

## 6) Advertising & Marketing Rules (MARKETING Only)

### Required

- No false/misleading claims
- Include HIC number where required/appropriate
- Do not claim certifications you don’t hold

### Prohibited (Blockers)

- “Lowest prices guaranteed” (unless you have a documented policy)
- “Fastest in New Jersey” (unless substantiated)
- “100% waterproof guarantee”
- Comparative claims without evidence
- Fake reviews/testimonials
- Stock photos presented as your work

### Allowed (if true)

- “TCNA/ANSI-aligned installation methods” _(don’t imply certification—just
  method alignment)_
- “Written estimates provided” _(only if operationally true)_

---

## 7) Safety & DIY Content Rules (EDUCATIONAL/DIY Only)

If the content teaches methods that can create hazard (silica dust, demolition,
lead, electrical, structural), it must include:

- PPE/controls callouts (silica, ventilation, eye protection)
- A “know your limits / hire a pro” disclaimer

### DIY Disclaimer (safe default)

> Educational content only. Construction work can create serious safety and
> property risks. Follow manufacturer instructions, applicable codes, and safety
> standards. If you’re not qualified, hire a licensed professional.

---

## 8) Environmental & Lead/Asbestos (When Older Homes or Demo Is Mentioned)

If the content references work that disturbs painted surfaces or older flooring:

- Mention lead-safe practices / EPA RRP applicability
- Recommend testing when suspect materials are present (lead/asbestos)

Keep it factual; avoid giving “how to bypass” steps.

---

## 9) Data Privacy & Photo Permissions (All Contexts)

- Don’t publish client addresses, identifying details, invoices, or private
  messages
- Don’t publish jobsite photos for marketing without permission
- Blur plates, faces, house numbers, and identifying details when unsure

---

## 10) Warranty & Insurance Statements (Truth-Only)

Only state warranty duration and insurance coverage if accurate and current.

If you publish warranty language:

- Define coverage clearly (workmanship vs manufacturer materials)
- Define exclusions (impact damage, maintenance failures, unauthorized repairs)

---

## 11) AI Content Rules (Applies Everywhere)

### Hard Prohibitions (Blockers)

- Fabricated reviews/testimonials
- False claims about licenses/certifications
- “Guaranteed” results
- Legal advice presented as counsel
- Medical/health claims

### Required Disclaimers (Context-Based)

- **Pricing/estimates**: “Prices vary by site conditions/material selections.”
- **DIY/how-to**: educational + safety disclaimer (see §7)

---

## 12) Deployment Rule: Compliance Must Help Fix Failures

When a compliance check fails, the enforcement mechanism must output:

1. **Severity** (BLOCKER / REQUIRED / RECOMMENDED)
2. **Exact failing text snippet** (or file + line range)
3. **Why it fails** (one sentence)
4. **A proposed patch** (replacement text that passes)
5. **The minimal-change option** (smallest edit to unblock)

**No “just block” behavior is acceptable** unless it’s a BLOCKER.

---

## 13) Minimal Compliance Checklist (Fast + Practical)

### For MARKETING pages

- [ ] HIC # appears somewhere appropriate
- [ ] No guarantees / no fake reviews / no unprovable superlatives
- [ ] No claims of certifications unless verified

- [ ] DIY safety disclaimer present
- [ ] Safety hazards mentioned where relevant (silica, PPE, ventilation)

### For ESTIMATE/CONTRACT templates

- [ ] Business identity + HIC #
- [ ] Scope, pricing, dates/scheduling method, change orders, warranty
- [ ] Uses verified cancellation language from your approved template

### For GENERAL pages

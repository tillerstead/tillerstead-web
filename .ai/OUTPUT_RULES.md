# OUTPUT_RULES.md — Code Quality & Deployment-Safe Standards

**Inherits From**: `SYSTEM.md`
**Scope**: Code, documentation, assets, and workflow standards
**Applies To**: Files modified in a given commit (context-aware)
**Authority**: Tillerstead conventions, TCNA, NJ HIC (where applicable), WCAG 2.1, modern web standards

---

# 1) Purpose

This document defines quality, accessibility, and safety standards **without
blocking unrelated deployments**.

**Core principle**:

> A rule only blocks deployment if the modified file type is within that rule’s
> scope **and** the violation presents a real functional, accessibility,
> security, or legal risk.

Formatting tweaks, copy edits, and unrelated documentation updates **must never
be blocked** by CSS, JS, or HTML rules.

---

## 2) Enforcement Model (Mandatory)

All rules are classified by **severity** and **scope**.

### Severity Levels

#### A. BLOCKER (must block commit/deploy)

Used only when the issue causes:

- Runtime failure
- Security exposure
- Accessibility failure (WCAG AA regression)
- Broken build
- Legal/compliance violation

#### B. REQUIRED (must be fixed _only if applicable_)

Must be fixed **when the modified file falls within the rule’s scope**.

#### C. RECOMMENDED (never blocks)

Best practices, optimization goals, or stylistic consistency.

---

## 3) Scope Awareness (Non-Negotiable)

A rule **only applies** if the commit modifies files in its scope.

| Rule Type         | Applies Only If Commit Touches                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| HTML rules        | `*.html`, Jekyll layouts/includes                  |
| CSS/SCSS rules    | `*.css`, `*.scss`                                  |
| JS rules          | `*.js`, `*.mjs`                                    |
| Jekyll rules      | `_layouts/`, `_includes/`, pages with front matter |
| Performance rules | HTML/CSS/JS affecting render path                  |
| Docs rules        | `README.md`, `*.md`                                |
| Assets            | `images/`, `svg/`, fonts                           |

**If no scoped files are modified → rule is skipped automatically.**

---

## 4) File Naming & Structure

### Severity: REQUIRED (Scoped)

Applies only to **new or renamed files**.

#### HTML

- `kebab-case.html`
- Root pages: `index.html`, `404.html`, `success.html`

#### CSS / SCSS

- `kebab-case.css`
- SCSS partials must start with `_`

#### JavaScript

- `camelCase.js` (preferred) or `kebab-case.js`
- Be consistent within a directory

#### Images / SVG

- `kebab-case.svg|png|jpg|webp`
- `icon-*`, `pattern-*` prefixes where applicable

#### Directories

- `kebab-case/`
- Underscore-prefixed only for system dirs (`_includes`, `_layouts`, `_sass`)

---

## 5) HTML Standards

### HTML Severity

- **BLOCKER**: Broken semantics, duplicate IDs, missing labels on form controls
- **REQUIRED**: Semantic structure, meta basics
- **RECOMMENDED**: Advanced SEO/perf enhancements

### Semantic & Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

- One `<h1>` per page
- Logical heading order
- `<label for>` on all form inputs
- `alt` text required for informative images
- ARIA only when semantic HTML is insufficient

### Meta & SEO (REQUIRED)

- `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
- `<meta name="viewport">`
- Unique `<title>`
- `<meta name="description">`

### Performance (RECOMMENDED unless regression detected)

- `loading="lazy"` for non-critical images
- Defer or module-load scripts
- Responsive images via `srcset`

### HTMLHint

- **BLOCKER only if HTMLHint error affects rendering or accessibility**
- Style-only warnings → **RECOMMENDED**

---

## 6) CSS / SCSS Standards

### CSS Severity

- **BLOCKER**: Broken build, invalid CSS
- **REQUIRED**: Token usage for theme-critical styles
- **RECOMMENDED**: Optimization and architecture rules

### Tokens

- Prefer CSS variables and SCSS tokens
- **Exception allowed** for:
  - Third-party overrides
  - One-off experimental components
  - Temporary debug styling (must be removed before release)

### Architecture

- Mobile-first
- Grid for layout, Flexbox for alignment
- BEM-style naming preferred, not enforced

### Linting

- Stylelint warnings do **not** block unless they cause invalid CSS or visual
  breakage

---

## 7) JavaScript Standards

### JS Severity

- **BLOCKER**: Runtime errors, uncaught promise rejections, syntax failures
- **REQUIRED**: ES6+, error handling in async code
- **RECOMMENDED**: Performance optimizations

### Rules

- Use `const` / `let`
- Wrap async logic in `try/catch`
- Fail gracefully — UI must not hard-crash

### ESLint

- Errors that break execution → **BLOCKER**
- Style preferences → **RECOMMENDED**

---

## 8) Jekyll / Liquid

### Jekyll Severity: REQUIRED (Scoped)

Applies only to files with front matter or Liquid usage.

- Front matter must include `layout`, `title`, `description`
- Avoid heavy logic in templates
- Prefer data files for complexity

---

## 9) Performance Targets

### Performance Severity

- **BLOCKER**: Regressions that materially degrade UX
- **RECOMMENDED**: Target scores

### Targets (Goals, not gates)

- Desktop: Perf ≥ 90
- Mobile: Perf ≥ 85
- Accessibility ≥ 95
- CLS < 0.1, LCP < 2.5s

Performance budgets **must not block copy-only or doc-only commits**.

---

## 10) Documentation Rules

### Documentation Severity: REQUIRED (Scoped)

- Update docs **only when behavior, structure, or usage changes**
- No requirement to update README for cosmetic or copy edits

---

## 11) Git Commit Standards

### Severity: REQUIRED

Conventional Commits format:

```text
type(scope): subject
```

- Enforced only on **commit message**
- Never blocks file content changes

---

## 12) Security

### Severity: BLOCKER

- Secrets, API keys, credentials
- Personal data
- Private client information

Use `.env` (gitignored) and environment config.

---

## 13) Mandatory Failure Behavior (Critical Fix)

If a rule fails, the enforcement system **must output**:

1. **Severity**
2. **File(s) and line range**
3. **Why it failed (plain English)**
4. **Exact proposed fix**
5. **Minimal-change alternative**

> A failure without a proposed fix is itself non-compliant.
